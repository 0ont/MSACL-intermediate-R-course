## What is reproducible research?

In its simplest form, reproducible research is the principle that any research result can be reproduced by anybody. Or, per Wikipedia: "The term reproducible research refers to the idea that the ultimate product of academic research is the paper along with the laboratory notebooks and full computational environment used to produce the results in the paper such as the code, data, etc. that can be used to reproduce the results and create new work based on the research."

Reproducibility can be achieved when the following criteria are met [(Marecelino 2016)](https://www.r-bloggers.com/what-is-reproducible-research/):
- All methods are fully reported
- All data and files used for the analysis are available
- The process of analyzing raw data is well reported and preserved

*But I'm not doing research for a publication, so why should I care about reproducible research?*

- Someone else may need to run your analysis (or you may want someone else to do the analysis so it's less work for you)
- You may want to improve on that analysis
- You will probably want to run the same exact analysis or a very similar analysis on the same data set or a new data set in the future

**"Everything you do, you will probably have to do over again."** [(Noble 2009)](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)
