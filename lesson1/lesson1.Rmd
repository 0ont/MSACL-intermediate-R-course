## What is reproducible research?

In its simplest form, reproducible research is the principle that any research result can be reproduced by anybody. Or, per Wikipedia: "The term reproducible research refers to the idea that the ultimate product of academic research is the paper along with the laboratory notebooks and full computational environment used to produce the results in the paper such as the code, data, etc. that can be used to reproduce the results and create new work based on the research."
