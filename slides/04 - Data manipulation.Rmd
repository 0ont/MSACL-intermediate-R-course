## What is the tidyverse?

- According to the [tidyverse website](https://www.tidyverse.org/), "the tidyverse is an *opinionated* collection of R packages designed for data science
- Consistent interface for functions
- Special version of data frame - [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/articles/tibble.html)
  - Better printed output
  - More predictable behavior (does not change data types unexpectedly)

## Key concept: tidy data

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

## Consider different formats for 1 data set

4 variables: 

- country
- year
- population
- cases

## Representation 1

```{r, echo=FALSE}
table2
```

## Representation 2

```{r, echo=FALSE}
table3
```

## Representation 3 - tidy

```{r, echo=FALSE}
table1
```

## Manipulating data with dplyr

[dplyr package](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) provides functions to manipulate data frames (tibbles)

Conceptually broad categories of manipulation:

- carve: extract variables or cases
- expand: create new columns
- collapse: summarize data

## select() allows you to select specific columns by name

![Syntax for `select()`](../assets/select.png)

## Refresher on sample data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
samples_jan <- read_csv("data/2017-01-06_s.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    compoundName = col_factor(NULL),
    sampleType = col_factor(NULL)
    )
  ) %>% 
  clean_names()
str(samples_jan)
```

## Refresher on sample data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
samples_jan <- read_csv(here::here("data/2017-01-06_s.csv"),
  col_types = cols(
    compoundName = col_factor(NULL),
    sampleType = col_factor(NULL)
    )
  ) %>% 
  clean_names()
str(samples_jan)
```

## Example: select()

```{r, eval = FALSE}
samples_jan_subset <- samples_jan %>%
  select(batch_name:expected_concentration)
head(samples_jan_subset)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
samples_jan_subset <- samples_jan %>%
  select(batch_name:expected_concentration)
head(samples_jan_subset)
```

## Example: select()

```{r, eval = FALSE}
samples_jan_subset <- samples_jan %>%
  select(batch_name:compound_name, concentration)
head(samples_jan_subset)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
samples_jan_subset <- samples_jan %>%
  select(batch_name:compound_name, concentration)
head(samples_jan_subset)
```

## select() combined with starts_with()

```{r}
samples_jan_vars <- samples_jan %>%
  select(starts_with("sample"))
glimpse(samples_jan_vars)
```

## filter() allows you to pick rows (cases) based on values

![Syntax for `filter()`](../assets/filter.png)

## Example: filter()

```{r, eval = FALSE}
samples_jan %>%
  filter(compound_name == "morphine") %>% # note the two equal signs (one equal for assignment)
  head()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
samples_jan %>%
  filter(compound_name == "morphine") %>% # note the two equal signs (one equal for assignment)
  head()
```

## Example: filter() with more than one condition

```{r}
samples_jan %>%
  filter(sample_type == "unknown", concentration > 0) %>%
  head()
```

## Example: filter() with OR condition

```{r}
samples_jan %>%
  filter(sample_type == "unknown" | concentration > 0) %>%
  head()
```

## Exercise 1

Carve the January data set in both directions. Extract sample information (batch, sample, compound) and ion ratio data for only oxycodone measurements in unknown sample types with a concentration > 0. Provide a summary of the data.

## Exercise 1 Comments

- Order of operations may be very important
- tidylog package can be helpful to clarify how each operation impacted data set

## Expanding your data set

- `mutate()` function provides a quick and clean way to add additional variables
- argument(s): name of the new column = value

## Example: mutate()

```{r, eval = FALSE}
samples_jan %>%
  filter(sample_type == "standard", expected_concentration > 0) %>%
  mutate(conc_ratio = concentration/expected_concentration) %>%
  select(batch_name:compound_name, concentration, expected_concentration, conc_ratio) %>%
  head(20)
```

## Example: mutate()

```{r, echo = FALSE}
samples_jan %>%
  filter(sample_type == "standard", expected_concentration > 0) %>%
  mutate(conc_ratio = concentration/expected_concentration) %>%
  select(batch_name:compound_name, concentration, expected_concentration, conc_ratio) %>%
  head(20)
```

## Example: mutate() with case_when() logic

```{r, eval = FALSE}
samples_jan %>%
  filter(sample_type == "standard") %>%
  mutate(
    conc_ratio = case_when(
      expected_concentration == 0 ~ (concentration + 0.001)/(expected_concentration + 0.001),
      TRUE ~ concentration/expected_concentration
    )
  ) %>%
  select(batch_name:compound_name, concentration, expected_concentration, conc_ratio) %>%
  head(20)
```

## Example: mutate() with case_when() logic

```{r, echo = FALSE}
samples_jan %>%
  filter(sample_type == "standard") %>%
  mutate(
    conc_ratio = case_when(
      expected_concentration == 0 ~ (concentration + 0.001)/(expected_concentration + 0.001),
      TRUE ~ concentration/expected_concentration
    )
  ) %>%
  select(batch_name:compound_name, concentration, expected_concentration, conc_ratio) %>%
  head(20)
```

## Example: mutate() with lubridate functions

```{r, eval = FALSE}
batch_jan <- read_csv("data/2017-01-06_b.csv") %>%
  clean_names()
batch_jan_timestamps <- batch_jan %>%
  mutate(
    collect_datetime = ymd_hms(batch_collected_timestamp),
    collect_month = month(batch_collected_timestamp),
    collect_day_of_week = wday(batch_collected_timestamp),
    collect_week = week(batch_collected_timestamp)
  )
glimpse(batch_jan_timestamps)
```

## Example: mutate() with lubridate functions

```{r, eval = FALSE}
batch_jan <- read_csv("data/2017-01-06_b.csv") %>%
  clean_names()
batch_jan_timestamps <- batch_jan %>%
  mutate(
    collect_datetime = ymd_hms(batch_collected_timestamp),
    collect_month = month(batch_collected_timestamp),
    collect_day_of_week = wday(batch_collected_timestamp),
    collect_week = week(batch_collected_timestamp)
  )
glimpse(batch_jan_timestamps)
```

## Example: mutate() with lubridate functions

```{r, echo = FALSE}
batch_jan <- read_csv(here::here("data/2017-01-06_b.csv")) %>%
  clean_names()
batch_jan_timestamps <- batch_jan %>%
  mutate(
    collect_datetime = ymd_hms(batch_collected_timestamp),
    collect_month = month(batch_collected_timestamp),
    collect_day_of_week = wday(batch_collected_timestamp),
    collect_week = week(batch_collected_timestamp)
  )
glimpse(batch_jan_timestamps)
```

## Scoped variants of mutate()

- mutate_all() to apply to all variables
- mutate_at() to apply to a list of columns
- mutate_if() to apply to select variables with some condition

## mutate_if to convert characters to factors

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
batch_jan_factors<- batch_jan %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
summary(batch_jan_factors)
```

## mutate_if to convert characters to factors

```{r, echo = FALSE}
batch_jan_factors<- batch_jan %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
summary(batch_jan_factors)
```

## Exercise 2

How long an average does it take to review each batch? 

## Exercise 2 Comments

Probably want to coerce difftime function output to a number, for downstream analyses

## Collapse (summarize) your data set

- Group data by a variable using the `group_by()` function
- Couples with its summary function `summarize()`
- Allows summary calculations on specific groups within data set

## Example: grouping and summarizing

```{r}
samples_jan %>%
  filter(sample_type == "unknown", concentration > 0) %>%
  group_by(compound_name) %>%
  summarize(median_ir = median(ion_ratio),
            mean_ir = mean(ion_ratio),
            std_dev_ir = sd(ion_ratio))
```

## Example: grouping and summarizing by 2 variables

```{r}
samples_jan %>%
  filter(sample_type == "unknown", concentration > 0) %>%
  group_by(batch_name, compound_name) %>%
  summarize(median_ir = median(ion_ratio),
            mean_ir = mean(ion_ratio),
            std_dev_ir = sd(ion_ratio)) %>%
  head()
```

## Example: grouping and summarizing by 3 variables

```{r}
batch_jan_timestamps %>%
  group_by(instrument_name, compound_name, collect_week) %>%
  summarize(median_cor = median(calibration_r2),
            mean_cor = mean(calibration_r2),
            min_cor = min(calibration_r2),
            max_cor = max(calibration_r2))
```

## Exercise 3

From the January sample dataset, for samples with unknown sample type, what is the minimum, median, mean, and maximum concentration for each compound by batch? What is the mean of the within-batch means by compound?

## Shaping and tidying data with tidyr

Consider non-tidy data:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
samples_jan_messy <- read_csv("data/messy/2017-01-06-sample-messy.csv")
head(samples_jan_messy)
```

## Shaping and tidying data with tidyr

```{r, echo = FALSE}
samples_jan_messy <- read_csv(here::here("data/messy/2017-01-06-sample-messy.csv"))
head(samples_jan_messy)
```

## Gathering data with `pivot_longer()`

- `pivot_longer()` is new (and now recommended) approach
- use similar syntax, definition of arguments
  - specify the variable(s) you are gathering
  - specify the column names for the new columns that will contain the names and values you extract from the old column(s)


![Pivot longer](../assets/data_gather.png)

## Example: `pivot_longer()`

```{r}
samples_jan_tidy_longer <-samples_jan_messy %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-batch_name, -sample_name, -sample_type), names_to = "compound_name", values_to = "concentration")
head(samples_jan_tidy_longer)
```
*Note: names_to and values_to arguments + cols argument*

## Making data untidy

- Inverse operation of `pivot_longer()` is `pivot_wider()`
- Similar syntax:
  - Specify where new columns names come from
  - Specify where new column values come from

## Example: `pivot_wider()`

```{r}
samples_jan_remessy_wider <- samples_jan_tidy_longer %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "compound_name", values_from = "concentration")
head(samples_jan_remessy_wider)
```
*Note: names_from and values_from arguments*

## Exercise 4

The "2017-01-06-batch-messy.csv" file in the messy subdirectory of the data dir is related to the "2017-01-06.xlsx" batch file you have worked with before. Unfortunately, it is not set up to have a single observation per row. There are two problems that need to be solved:

1. Each parameter in a batch is represented with a distinct column per compound, but all compounds appear on the same row. Each compound represents a distinct observation, so these should appear on their own rows.
1. There are 3 parameters per obsevation (compound) - calibration slope, intercept, and R^2. However these appear on different lines. All 3 paramters need to appear on the same row.


## Summary

- The dplyr package offers a number of useful functions for manipulating data sets
  - `select()` subsets columns by name and `filter()` subset rows by condition
  - `mutate()` adds additional columns, typically with calculations or logic based on other columns
  - `group_by()` and `summarize()` allow grouping by one or more variables and performing calculations within the group
  
## Summary

- Manipulating dates and times with the lubridate package can make grouping by time periods easier
- The tidyr package provides functions to tidy and untidy data
